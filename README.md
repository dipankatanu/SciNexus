The idea is simple: PubMed searches are powerful, but they often rely on exact keywords.
SciNexus uses an LLM to broaden PubMed searches beyond exact terms and then connects the results using co-authorship networks to explore who is working with whom, where collaboration hubs form, and how research communities organize around a topic.
The tool can be used in a global or location-specific way and is meant for exploration, not definitive rankings.

I’ll keep iterating to improve search recall, affiliation handling, and network exploration.
Feedback and ideas are welcome.
