SciNexus is an open-source, work-in-progress project for exploring research landscapes using PubMed data.
It combines semantic filtering with co-authorship network analysis to surface potential domain experts, lab communities, and collaboration patterns.

This is a fun, ongoing side project - not a finished product. Many limitations exist (keyword sensitivity, author disambiguation, metadata gaps), and the goal is to iteratively improve and fix these over time.

Built for exploration, learning, and hypothesis generation.
Contributions, ideas, and critiques are very welcome.
